Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Undergraduate student in my Senior year studying Computer Science at Texas Tech University. I will be graduating Spring of 2021 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

My experience consists of a Web Development internship in Tokyo with Emurgo , and a research project at the Advanced Particle Detector Laboratory. I am currently looking for an internship/full-time opportunity.
